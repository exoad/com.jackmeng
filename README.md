**Versioning**<br>
Base Version: 0.0.1a (InDev)<br>
Latest Release: None

# Why?
This library isn't meant to replace the entirety of the JavaSDK and it's Standard Library, instead more of an extension to it. It adds functions to simplify the implementation of bootstrap code.
For third parties, I suggest you NOT use this library for any advanced computations and rely more on well known or even proprietary libraries that have much more thoughout functions.

In terms of my projects, this library helps to form the basis of all. Changing one specific parameter changes the functionality in all of my subsequent projects, allowing for zero hassle (where I have to go to each project and update the existing source code).

if you wish to use this library, this library is dual licensed and you must acknowledge either:

[BSD-3 "Revised"](./LICENSE.md)

[Apache 2.0](./LICENSE)

# Building
Run the platform specific Gradle build code for your system.
